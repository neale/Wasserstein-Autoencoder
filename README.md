# Wasserstein Adversarial Autoencoder Pytorch

This is an implementation of the WAE proposed architecture in PyTorch. This idea of adding a discriminator to the latent space instead of discriminating directly on pixels has been floating around VAE and disentanglement research for the last year. This WAE paper has formalize the process in terms of optimal transport, whoich is nice


This implementation is of the WAE. 

WAE-MMD and WAE-GAN have not been added, but soon will be.
